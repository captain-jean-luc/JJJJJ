Jean-luc's Judicial Jamboree

[i]A note about mod powers: I am a mod here, but I will not be using mod powers to enforce any of the rules of this game, even those in the "Constitution". The site-wide rules of course still apply.[/i]

Inspired by [url=https://community.tulpa.info/thread-break-dem-rules-probably-a-mess]Break dem rules[/url], [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_(card_game)]Mao[/url], and 20 Questions; it's Jean-luc's Judicial Jamboree! (I Am The Most Humblest edition)

[hr]
[b]Constitution[/b]
This is the list of rules that cannot be changed, overridden, altered, adapted, amended, edited, mutated, revised, abrogated, annuled, quashed, reversed, invalidated, negated, repealed, voided, revoked, or vetoed by player rules.

[list]
[*]RULER: Jean-luc is Supreme Ruler, Manager, Judge, Jury, and [s]Executioner[/s] Rule Enforcer.
[*]RIGHT: Jean-luc is always right.
[*]GAMEPOST: A post which starts with the exact word GAME (in all caps, as shown here) is said to be a "gamepost", unless the Judge says otherwise.
[*]COMMENTS: Unless the Judge says otherwise, any post which is not a gamepost and is not this post is a "comment post". Comment posts have no effect on the game, they cannot be used as evidence, and and player rules have no effect on these posts.
[*]INLINE COMMENTS: Inline comments can be added to gameposts by putting text in [##] tags, eg [##]this is a comment[/##]. The content of the comment and the comment tags have no effect on the game, cannot be used as evidence, and player rules have no effect.
[*]EDITING: Gameposts [b]must not be edited[/b].
[*]PLAYER RULES APPLICABILITY: New player rules apply to the post they are in and everything after (barring COMMENTS and INLINE COMMENTS) but nothing before.
[*]PLAYER RULES POSSIBILITY: Players are not allowed to make a rule that makes it infeasible for other players to continue playing.
[*]PLAYER RULES FAIRNESS: Players are not allowed to make a rule that unfairly benefits one or more players more than some other player.
[*]TIME LIMIT: The standard time limit whenever a response is required from a Player is 24 hours. Except,  there are no consequences of 
[*]PROSECUTE: If any player believes a rule has been broken, they may bring a case to the Judge. To do that, the player will say CASE just after GAMEPOST, and then explain what rule they believe was broken and why. That player becomes the first Claimant. Any player can join as Claimant or Respondent.
Judge system:
Player calls point of order, makes some claim about rule broken or some such
Game pauses until Judge resolves it.
Any player can join ClaimAnt or DefendEnt side.
Joining DefendEnt side means "I think ClaimAnt is wrong".
Any player can leave either side.
If all players leave ClaimAnt side, case is dropped and play continues.
Sides give arguments as to why they're right, bring evidence(?), anything else?
Sides can ask for extension/continuance?
Judge makes verdict, if verdict is contrary to how play continued (time limit to bring cases?) then play is reverted to that point.
[*]PUNISHMENT: When a player has been found to have broken a rule, that player sometimes doesn't get to guess. More specifically, there is a counter we'll call [i]n[/i] that increments for every rule broken. Every question session, the player has a 1/([i]n[/i]+1) chance of being allowed to make a guess, I'll let you know at the beginning of the question session whether the odds were in your favor that session. At the end of the session, [i]n[/i] is decremented by 1.

[b]Base game[/b]
The base game is twenty questions! Except, more like infinite questions!
The game is played in rounds, and each round has an initial phase followed by Question Sessions because I can't stop naming things.
Each round, players are split into one Thinker (chosen randomly)
how to chose: sort players randomly, go in that order and then that order reversed? Is that fair?
and the rest of the players are Askers.
The Thinker thinks of a noun that can reasonably have questions asked and answered about it, and sends the noun to the Manager.
The Thinker thinks of a new Rule. The new Rule may be anything as long as it follows the Constitution.
The Thinker thinks of a "hint" for their noun (can you tell why they're called the Thinker yet?). Could be something silly, or super vague, or whatever.
The Thinker then posts their new rule and their hint. The first Question Session begins.

question session:
all players secretly come up with and commit to a question. After TIME LIMIT, all questions and their authors are revealed and answered. Answers must be Yes/No/I don't know/Probably/Probably Not

Round ends when someone guesses correctly
If multiple people get it right, point is divided between winners.
